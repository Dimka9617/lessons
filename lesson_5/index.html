					<p><span>Slipknot</span> have come a long way. From the basements of Des Moines, Iowa, to the main stage
						at Download festival, Slipknot's journey is one of inspiration. One of the most successful metal
						band's of the century, and one of
						the few to emerge from the nu metal boom of the early noughties with their integrity in tact, the
						nine-man killing machine have released five albums and played to millions of fans (also known as
						maggots) throughout the world.
					</p>
					<p>But it hasn't been easy. Iowa remains one of the darkest records of all time, owing much to the psyche
						and headspace the band were occupying at the time, and the band's
						<a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/slipknot-s-paul-gray-remembered">
							founding member Paul
							Gray
							died in
							2010.

					<p>If you're new to the world of Slipknot then welcome, but tread carefully, because here be monsters.
						Below, we'll answer any question you may have. Who are Slipknot? What's up with that nine-pointed
						star? What are their biggest songs?

				<div class="members__text text">
					<p>There are nine members of Slipknot, although the line-up has changed numerous times since their
						formation in 1995. The current line-up of Slipknot is Corey Taylor on vocals, Shawn ‘Clown’ Crahan and
						Chris Fehn on percussion, Mick Thomson
						and Jim Root on guitar, Alessandro ‘V Man’ Venturella on bass, Jay Weinberg on drums, Sid Wilson on
						turntables and Craig ‘133’ Jones on samples and keyboards.

					<p>The classic Slipknot line-up (from 1999-2010) featured Joey Jordison on drums and Paul Gray on bass.
						Paul Gray was replaced by V Man in 2014 following Paul’s death in 2010, and Jay Weinberg replaced Joey
						Jordison following his departure
						from Slipknot in 2013 following a battle with his health.
